# Interactive Birthday Celebration Website

> A multi-page, interactive website to celebrate a special birthday with animations, music, and a virtual memory lane.

This project is a creative and personalized way to send birthday wishes. It's a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring several animated pages, background music, and a "memory lane" to showcase special moments.

## Features

* **Interactive Greeting:** An engaging landing page to welcome the user.
* **Virtual Cake:** An animated birthday cake with candles.
* **Memory Lane:** A dedicated page to display photos and memories.
* **Background Music:** Includes a "Happy Birthday" audio track to create a festive atmosphere.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled to be viewed on different screen sizes.

## How to View the Website

Since this is a static website, you can run it directly in your web browser.

1.  **Download the Code:**
    * Click the green "Code" button on the GitHub repository page.
    * Select "Download ZIP".
    * Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Open the Website:**
    * Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
    * Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several HTML pages, each with its own CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity:

* `index.html`: The main landing page.
* `cake.html`: The page with the virtual birthday cake.
* `memorylane.html`: The page for showcasing memories.
* `page.html`: An additional page for more content.
* `happy-birthday.mp3`: The background music file.
* `images/`: A folder to store all the images used in the project.

## How to Customize

You can easily customize this project for a different person or occasion:

* **Change the Text:** Open the `.html` files in a text editor and change the text content to your liking.
* **Change the Images:** Replace the images in the `images/` folder with your own. Make sure the new image names match the old ones, or update the image paths in the HTML and CSS files.
